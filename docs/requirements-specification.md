# Requirements Specification

_The requirements specification comprehends the requirements on the system under consideration by taking a black-box view on the system. This means, we specify requirements from a user's perspective without constraining (or even without having to understand) the internal realisation of the system. This comprehends, for example, use cases (or user stories, depending on preferences and choices), and non-functional requirements._

## System Vision

_The system vision comprehends the system context of the system under consideration, which is intended to realise a number of features. A feature is a prominent or distinctive user-recognisable aspect, quality, or characteristic of a system. In addition, we specify an use case overview, i.e. a (potentially) graphical overview of the use cases._
